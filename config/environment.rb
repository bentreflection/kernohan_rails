Kelly offers private, one-one-one lessons for those looking to increase range and strength, eliminate vocal breaks, correct bad habits, repair damage or add quality to their voice.</p>
<h2>Can you sing from chest voice to head voice without cracking?</h2>
<p>Kelly can teach you to experience the full range of your voice without cracking or straining. By focusing on vocal exercises that blend the chest and head together, Kelly teaches you how to sing freely in a balanced voice.</p>
<h2>Does your voice get tired or hoarse?</h2>
<p>Many singers experience throat tightness or fatigue as they sing higher. Kelly teaches a balance between air flow and muscle which relieves the throat of voice damaging tension.</p>
<h2>Can you sing as high as you'd like?</h2>
<p>When a singer can't get past their bridges, they assume all higher notes are out of their range. By helping students transition correctly between their bridges, Kelly helps singers drastically improve their range.</p>"

Speech Level Singingâ„¢ (SLS) is a revolutionary vocal training technique that maximizes your vocal abilities in any style of singing.
</p>
<p class='first'>From Opera to Rock; Jazz to Pop or R&B, over 120 Grammy award winners have studied this revolutionary technique.</p>
<p>Speech Level Singing is founded on the concept of singing in the same comfortable manner as you speak, providing a healthy technique for all voices and all styles. The SLS technique allows you to sing through your entire range (three or more octaves) without breaking, straining, or changing quality. The larynx (the bump on your neck) houses your vocal cords. A singer who uses improper technique will find that the larynx will rise as they sing higher. The result sounds 'shouty', creates tension, and damages the vocal cords.</p>
<p>Speech Level Singing teaches the larynx to stay relaxed through your entire range and teaches the cords to make the proper adjustments while balancing air flow. As a result, the singer will be able to produce the correct resonance shifts through their bridges without any disconnection. With this technique you'll be able to sing through all your bridges in a strong, balanced voice ready for any pitch, any volume, or any style!</p>"
